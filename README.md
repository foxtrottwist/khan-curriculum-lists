# Khan Academy Curriculum Browser

A React-based curriculum management tool that connects to Khan Academy's API to help parents and homeschoolers organize personalized learning paths for their children across mathematics, science, computing, arts, and economics.

## Purpose

My first React project, built out of necessity while homeschooling my son. I needed a way to browse Khan Academy's extensive course catalog and create focused study plans without losing track of which courses we'd selected across different subjects. What started as a practical parenting solution became my introduction to React development and later, my learning ground for modern React patterns.

## Project Context

This was my entry point into React development, driven by the practical need to organize my son's homeschool curriculum. Originally built using React class components when I first learned the framework, I later rewrote the entire application using Hooks when React 16.8 introduced them. This refactoring became an invaluable learning experience in modern React patterns.

The evolution from classes to Hooks transformed how I approached state management - what once required `this.setState` and lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` became clean, functional approaches with `useState` and `useEffect`. The modal system particularly benefited from the Hooks refactor, with `useRef` and `useEffect` providing cleaner event handling than the previous class-based implementation.

**Technical Evolution:**
- Started with React class components and lifecycle methods
- Refactored to functional components with useState and useEffect
- Learned modern React patterns through practical application
- Component composition improved through Hooks-based architecture
- State management became more predictable and easier to reason about

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Hands-on experience with both React paradigms (classes â†’ Hooks)
- API integration patterns with fetch and Promise handling
- Component composition and modern React patterns
- CSS-in-JS styling with styled-components
- Local storage for client-side persistence

This project represents both my introduction to React and my adaptation to its evolution. What started as a parenting tool became the foundation for understanding how React development practices have modernized, giving me firsthand experience with the framework's progression from classes to Hooks.
